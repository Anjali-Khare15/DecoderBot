The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the factors influencing customer churn in a bank. We'll develop a comprehensive analysis and visualization solution in Python to gain insights into customer churn patterns, account attributes, transaction histories, and customer demographics. The project will provide valuable insights to the bank's management to devise strategies for reducing churn and enhancing customer retention. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the project:

1. Data Preparation
We start by loading and cleaning the dataset to ensure it's ready for analysis.

Steps:

Load the dataset.

Handle missing values and correct data types.

Display summary statistics to understand the dataset's structure.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps uncover patterns and trends in the data.

Steps:

Customer Demographics:

Analyze the gender distribution to understand the customer base.

Examine the age distribution to identify age groups prone to churn.

Account Attributes and Transaction Histories:

Investigate account balances to see financial behavior.

Explore transaction frequency to understand customer activity levels.

Customer Churn Patterns:

Determine the overall churn rate.

Analyze churn patterns by age and other demographic factors.

Visualizations:

Bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize distributions and patterns.

3. Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis helps identify relationships between different attributes.

Steps:

Compute the correlation matrix.

Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to highlight strong correlations.

4. Interactive Visualizations
Using tools like Plotly and Streamlit, we create interactive visualizations to present our findings.

Interactive Visualizations:

Gender Distribution

Age Distribution

Account Balance Distribution

Transaction Frequency Distribution

Churn Distribution

Correlation Heatmap

5. Presentation
We compile the findings into a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation to communicate our insights effectively.
